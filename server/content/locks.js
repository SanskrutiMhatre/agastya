/*
  The content lock (PROMPT.md "Approval workflow"; decisions.md L1-L4).

  While a publication request is pending, the publication module and the
  data modules it was submitted with are read-only for every Author on the
  project, and so are the other sources frozen with them (their graphics and
  BREX, and project.json): otherwise replacing one would make the request
  stale and so lift the lock. The locked set of a project is the union of
  the files frozen in its pending requests (each snapshot's manifest), so a
  data module placed in two publications is locked by a pending request on
  either. A request that
  is withdrawn, rejected, sent back with "changes requested", approved or
  made stale is no longer pending, and its files unlock at once: nothing is
  stored about the lock itself.

  The Software Administrator is exempt: an administrator edit goes through
  the override path (decisions.md V3, V5) and marks the request stale
  instead. Because that ends someone else's request, a save of a frozen file
  by the administrator is refused (409 OVERRIDE_MAKES_STALE, naming the
  request) until they acknowledge it.
